This is a lua binding to MultiFast[1], which is used for quickly and efficiently searching text for multiple strings.

It depends specifically on the ahocorasick library (part of MultiFast). This is also available packaged for Ubuntu (as libahocorasick0) in a PPA[2].

When not using the Ubuntu packages, the supplied multifast-v1.0.0.patch must be applied to the MultiFast source package before compilation.
